description: Premium shader and postprocessing stack for studio-grade WebGL on the ether engine. Documents the LDR-composer bloom + dither preset, the iridescent fresnel + cheap-noise vertex displacement material pattern, the extruded-word text pipeline, and the engine-vs-site shader boundary. Use this — not ether-threejs — whenever the task is writing or tuning GLSL, a ShaderMaterial, an iridescent fresnel material, vertex displacement, MSDF/extruded 3D text, or the bloom+dither composer (ether-threejs owns scene architecture; this owns the shader and material layer). Triggers on GLSL, fragment shader, vertex shader, custom material, ShaderMaterial, dither, bloom, postprocessing, fresnel, iridescent, displacement, surface noise, extruded text, 3D type, MSDF, premium material, raw GLSL import, sculpture material, ExtrudeGeometry, brand-as-form. Do NOT use when "bloom", "displacement", or "dither" appear outside a GLSL/WebGL material context, or when the existing engine postfx composer already covers the need — reference it, don't rebuild.

# ether-shaders

Technique reference for the shader + postprocessing + extruded-text stack in the [ether](https://github.com/JonathanBeck1/ether) engine. Invoke before writing any shader, postprocessing change, or text-as-form work on a site built on it.

## When to use

Any of:
- Writing a new `ShaderMaterial`, vertex shader, or fragment shader.
- Modifying postprocessing (bloom, dither, color grading, new effects).
- Adding or tuning extruded text — hero treatments, chapter heads.
- Diagnosing a banding / glow / type-ghosting / displacement-blur issue.

Invoke alongside `ether-threejs` (the general slop checklist) — this skill specializes, the other generalizes.

## Read first

1. The `ether-threejs` SKILL.md — the general "no AI-slop three.js" checklist applies first.
2. `recipes.md` in this directory — nine numbered recipes.
3. Your studio's taste doc, if the repo has one — what lands vs. what doesn't.

## The engine / site boundary

- **Engine owns** (ether `src/`):
  - `postfx/composer.ts` — `createComposer`, the one composer shape: render → your effects → (ACES when `hdr`) → dither, fused into a single `EffectPass`.
  - `postfx/heroComposer.ts` — three tunings of it: `createHeroComposer` (restrained LDR bloom for a dark scene with one bright accent), `createNightComposer` (hotter bloom for scenes whose light IS emissive geometry; exposes the optional `hdr` flag), `createLightComposer` (dither only — bloom on a pale ground just lifts the ground).
  - `postfx/DitherEffect.ts` — per-pixel hash grain applied through the sRGB transfer. Separately, `shaders/dither.glsl` is a standalone 8×8 Bayer chunk for your own materials; the effect does not use it.
  - `primitives/ShaderQuad` — backdrop plane with auto-wired `uTime` / `uAspect`.
  - `text/extrudedWord` — opentype → SVGLoader → ExtrudeGeometry pipeline (type as form).
  - `text/msdf` — `msdfText`, a troika-backed MSDF mesh (type as text), on its own entry so the optional peer stays optional.
- **Your site owns** (`src/shaders/<scene>/`):
  - The hero material shaders — your identity. Site-specific until a second consumer needs them.
  - Backdrop shaders (caustics, gradients, generative fields).

The engine is brand-free by construction: it ships wiring and takes the palette as uniforms, so the site injects its own colors. Don't promote site shaders to the engine without a generalization pass (uniform-driven palettes, no hardcoded brand-token vec3s).

## Hard rules

- **Follow the project's configured shader import convention** — `vite-plugin-glsl`, `?raw` (`import frag from './x.frag.glsl?raw'`), or inline strings. When adding a shader, use what the codebase already does; don't mix strategies without a reason.
- **`optimizeDeps.exclude: ['ether']`** is mandatory in your `astro.config.ts` (or Vite config) for a git / `file:` install, which ships raw `.ts`. esbuild's dep-scan can't parse the engine's Vite-only `?raw` GLSL imports; excluding it routes those files through Vite's full plugin pipeline instead.
- **Never set `preserveSymlinks: true`** for a `file:` layout — it pins the engine at its node_modules path, which Vite ignores for file-watching, so engine edits never hot-reload and it gets served as a stale cached external dep. Its one job (resolving the engine's bare `three` / `postprocessing` imports into the *site's* node_modules) is done correctly by `resolve.dedupe: ['three', 'postprocessing', …]` — set that instead. Both rules live together in `astro.config.ts`.
- **Three composer presets exist — pick one, don't mutate one into the other.** All three are thin tunings over `createComposer`; if none fits, write a fourth on `createComposer` rather than parameterising an existing one. `createHeroComposer` takes `PresetOptions` and is LDR by design — it never passes `hdr`, so values clip at 1.0 deliberately as bloom containment. Only `createNightComposer` re-exposes `hdr` (`NightComposerOptions`), which switches on `HalfFloatType` buffers + an ACES `ToneMappingEffect` and makes `toneMappingExposure` live. `createLightComposer` is dither-only.
- **Edge AA comes from the composer's `multisampling`, never the context `antialias` flag.** Post-processing renders into textures that bypass the canvas framebuffer, so context MSAA is visually dead the moment a composer runs (the quality profile sets `antialias: false` and carries `msaaSamples` instead — wire via `createHeroComposer(renderer, scene, camera, { multisampling: quality.msaaSamples })`).
- **Dither runs on every tier.** The quality profile ships `enablePostFX: true` and `enableDither: true` on LOW, MID and HIGH alike — tiers differ only in `msaaSamples` (HIGH 4 / MID 2 / LOW 0). It merges into the SAME fullscreen pass as bloom (a few ALU ops — effectively free) and kills the dark-gradient banding that reads as posterized color on mobile OLED. Never gate it on tier at a call site.
- **Bloom intensity `0.06` is the hero-preset ceiling.** Higher = glow-spam. Raise `luminanceThreshold` to gate harder if you need more visible bloom. The night preset ships `0.38` by design — its own ceiling, not a license to raise the hero's.
- **Custom `ShaderMaterial` only on hero elements.** No `MeshBasicMaterial` / `MeshStandardMaterial` for hero content. See `ether-threejs`.
- **Brand tokens through uniforms.** Pull colors from your site's constants module — the engine never names a color. If tokens are mirrored in CSS, update both when a color changes.
- **Wire `uTime` through the scene tick.** Material uniforms updated from `tick()` or via a wrapper's `tickUniforms`. Never via setInterval.
- **Add `precision highp float;`** at the top of fragment shaders explicitly — three.js prepends it by default, but stating it inline keeps the intent durable across pipeline changes.

## Slop indicators (do not ship)

- Default materials (`MeshBasicMaterial`, `MeshStandardMaterial`) on hero elements.
- Bloom `intensity > 0.1` on the hero preset, or `luminanceThreshold < 0.5` (the night preset ships 0.38 by design).
- Hardcoded `vec3(...)` colors in shaders.
- Ambient particle fields with no narrative function (see `ether-threejs`).
- ShaderMaterial without `uTime` wired through the engine's tick.
- `dat.gui` left in production builds.
- `console.log` inside shader hot paths.
- ExtrudedWord with `curveSegments < 6` on hero treatments.
- Single-color iridescent rim (must be a dual-color mix by normal direction).
- Promoting a site shader to the engine without uniformising the color palette.
- Vertex displacement strong enough to blur bevels on letter-extrusion geometry.

## Procedure for a new ShaderMaterial

1. **Confirm against the `ether-threejs` slop checklist first** — general rules apply before specifics.
2. **Decide ownership** — is the shader reusable across sites (engine) or brand-specific (site)? Default: site, until a second consumer exists.
3. **Place files** — `src/shaders/<scene>/<name>.{vert,frag}.glsl`. Import them by the project's existing convention.
4. **Wire uniforms through your constants module** — brand colors, displacement amplitudes, fresnel exponents.
5. **Tick uniforms** from the scene's `tick()` (or a wrapping class's `tickUniforms`).
6. **Add `precision highp float;`** to fragment shaders.
7. **Test against the hero composer.** If your material needs HDR values, the LDR composer clips them — rework to 0..1 (preferred) or use the night preset.
8. **Run `premium-review`** before reporting complete.

## After the skill

- Run the `premium-review` subagent on any shader work before reporting complete.
- If the shader is scroll-bound, also invoke `ether-scroll` for the bridge pattern.
- If creating a new dimensional-type treatment, cite the `extrudedWord` options you chose in the commit message — future grep will find the lineage.
